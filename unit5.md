# Hadoop Ecosystem Frameworks: Applications on Big Data Using Pig, Hive, and HBase

## Pig: Introduction to Pig

Apache Pig is a high-level platform for processing large datasets in Hadoop. It uses a language called Pig Latin, which simplifies data transformations and processing tasks.

### Execution Modes of Pig:
- **Local Mode**: Runs on a single machine, useful for small-scale development and testing.
- **MapReduce Mode**: Runs on a Hadoop cluster, suitable for large-scale data processing.

### Comparison of Pig with Databases:
- **Pig**: Designed for handling large-scale data processing with complex operations (joins, filtering) using a procedural language.
- **Databases**: Typically rely on SQL, more suited for transactional queries and smaller data sets.

### Grunt:
Grunt is the command-line interface for Pig, allowing interactive execution of Pig Latin commands.

### Pig Latin:
Pig Latin is a data flow language used in Pig. It provides commands to load data, apply transformations, and store results.

**Example**:
```pig
A = LOAD 'data.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (name:chararray, age:int);
B = FILTER A BY age > 21;
DUMP B;
```
### User Defined Functions (UDFs):
UDFs allow users to write custom functions to extend Pig's capabilities. UDFs can be written in Java, Python, or other supported languages.

### Data Processing Operators:
- **LOAD**: Loads data from external sources.
- **FILTER**: Filters data based on conditions.
- **GROUP**: Groups data by specified fields.
- **JOIN**: Joins multiple data sets.
- **ORDER**: Orders data.
- **FOREACH**: Applies transformations on each record in a dataset.

## Hive: Apache Hive Architecture and Installation

Apache Hive is a data warehouse system built on top of Hadoop that provides a higher-level interface for querying large datasets using HiveQL (a SQL-like language).

### Hive Architecture:
- **Hive Client**: The interface where users can submit HiveQL queries.
- **Hive Server**: Manages interactions between the client and the underlying Hadoop system.
- **Metastore**: Stores metadata about Hive tables, partitions, and schemas.
- **Execution Engine**: Translates HiveQL queries into MapReduce jobs for execution on Hadoop.

### Hive Shell:
The command-line interface for running HiveQL queries and managing tables.

### Hive Services:
Services in Hive include HiveServer2, Metastore Service, and Thrift Service.

### Hive Metastore:
The Metastore stores metadata (schema, tables, partitions) about the data in Hive. It allows users to query information about data without scanning the entire data set.

### Comparison with Traditional Databases:
- Hive is designed to handle petabytes of data in Hadoop clusters and uses MapReduce for query execution.
- Traditional databases are optimized for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) and can handle complex joins and transactions.

### HiveQL:
HiveQL is a SQL-like query language used to query Hive tables. It supports common SQL operations such as `SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY`.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT name, AVG(age) FROM users GROUP BY name;
```
## Hive: Tables, Querying Data, and UDFs

### Tables:
Tables in Hive can be either managed or external.
- **Managed Tables**: Controlled by Hive; if a managed table is deleted, the data is also deleted.
- **External Tables**: Controlled by the underlying file system; the data is not deleted when the table is dropped.

### Querying Data and User Defined Functions (UDFs):
UDFs in Hive allow for custom functions written in Java, Python, or other languages to be used in queries.

### Sorting and Aggregating:
Hive supports sorting and aggregation operations in HiveQL, such as:
- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result based on specified columns.
- **GROUP BY**: Groups data based on specified columns for aggregation.

### MapReduce Scripts:
Hive can generate MapReduce jobs from queries to process large datasets. This allows for the execution of complex queries at scale.

### Joins and Subqueries:
Hive supports:
- **JOINs**: (inner, outer, etc.) for combining data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries**: To filter and manipulate data at different levels of aggregation.

## HBase: Concepts, Clients, and Example

HBase is a distributed, scalable NoSQL database built on top of Hadoop that provides real-time access to large datasets.

### HBase Concepts:
- **Row Key**: Uniquely identifies a record in a table.
- **Column Family**: Groups columns into logical units for efficient access and storage.
- **Column**: Individual data elements associated with a row.
- **Cell**: The intersection of a row and column, which stores the actual data value.

### Clients:
HBase provides a Java client API for interacting with the database. Clients can read, write, and scan data using HBase's API or through HBase Shell.

### Example: Inserting Data into HBase:
```java
HTable table = new HTable(config, "users");
Put p = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("row1"));
p.add(Bytes.toBytes("personal"), Bytes.toBytes("name"), Bytes.toBytes("John"));
table.put(p);
```
## HBase vs RDBMS:
HBase is optimized for real-time access to large, sparse datasets, while RDBMS is designed for structured data and transactions.

### Advanced Usage:
- **Bulk Loading**: HBase supports bulk loading of data to efficiently ingest large datasets.
- **Scalable Indexing**: Allows efficient lookup of data through custom indexing schemes.
- **Versioning**: HBase supports versioning of data, enabling multiple versions of a record to be stored.

### Schema Design:
HBase schema design is critical for performance. The **row key** must be carefully chosen to avoid hotspots, ensuring efficient data distribution and access.

### Advanced Indexing:
HBase supports custom indexing schemes for efficient data lookup and querying, improving the speed of data retrieval.

## Zookeeper: How it Helps in Monitoring a Cluster

Zookeeper is a distributed coordination service that is used to manage configurations, synchronize distributed applications, and provide high-availability features in the Hadoop ecosystem.

### Cluster Monitoring:
Zookeeper helps in monitoring and managing the health of a distributed system by providing a central place for services to register, coordinate, and synchronize tasks.

### Building Applications with Zookeeper:
Zookeeper is often used for:
- **Leader Election**: Ensuring only one instance of a service is the leader at any time.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration storage and management.
- **Synchronization**: Synchronizing tasks across distributed services.

**Example**: In a distributed system, Zookeeper ensures that only one instance of a service is the leader at any time.
